Confirm that the coordinate fields are clearly labeled (e.g., Longitude , Latitude , X_Coord , Y_Coord ). Save the file locally on your computer and close it in Excel before importing. Open ArcGIS Pro Launch ArcGIS Pro and either create a new project or open an existing one. Add the CSV File to Your Map In the Catalog pane or using the Map tab, click Add Data and browse to the location of your CSV file. Add the file to your map. It will appear as a non-spatial table in the Contents pane . Display XY Data Right-click the table (CSV) in the Contents pane and select Display XY Data , or navigate to the Map tab and choose Add XY Data . In the dialog that opens, assign the appropriate fields for the X-coordinate (e.g., Longitude or X_Coord ) and Y-coordinate (e.g., Latitude or Y_Coord ). Choose the Correct Coordinate System If your data uses geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude), choose WGS 1984 . If your data uses projected coordinates or is intended for mapping in Louisiana, select the local coordinate system: NAD 1983 (2011) StatePlane Louisiana South FIPS 1702 (US Feet) (Well suited for South Louisiana projects such as transportation, utilities, and environmental mapping.) Create the XY Event Layer Click OK to create a temporary event layer on the map based on your coordinate fields and chosen spatial reference. Export to Shapefile Right-click the new XY event layer in the Contents pane and choose Data > Export Features . In the Export Features dialog: Choose a destination folder. Provide a meaningful name for your shapefile. Confirm the output coordinate system matches your project needs (preferably Louisiana South). Click OK to save the layer as a shapefile. Verify the Output The shapefile will now appear in your map as a permanent spatial layer. Compare its placement against a known basemap (e.g., imagery or roads) to confirm spatial accuracy. Optional: Add Metadata or Join Attributes Use ArcGIS Pro tools to further enrich the shapefile with metadata, attribute joins, or symbology based on other columns in your CSV.","title":"How to Convert a CSV File to a Shapefile in ArcGIS Pro (with Louisiana South Coordinate System)"},{"location":"index.html#how-to-convert-a-csv-file-to-a-shapefile-in-arcgis-pro-with-louisiana-south-coordinate-system","text":"Prepare Your CSV File Ensure your CSV file contains coordinate fields such as Latitude/Longitude or X/Y in projected units.
